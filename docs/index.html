            <h2>Board and Game</h2>

            <h4>On the game board, every game has black triangles on the side and corners, indicating which squares it
                can move to. A piece can only move one square at a time.</h4>
            <h4>Yellow moves first, and Blue moves second.</h4>

            <br/>
            <hr/>
            <br/>

            <h2>Pieces</h2>

            <h4>There are 5 kinds of pieces on the board: 子(pawn), 相(bishop), 将(rook), 侯(general), and
                王(king)</h4>
            <h4>Similar to Chess, if a player's king gets captured, the player loses.</h4>
            <h4>The pieces move like the following:</h4>

            <div style="padding: 3px">
                <h4>
                    子(pawn): One square forward
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    相(bishop): One square diagonally
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    将(rook): One square sideways
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    侯(general): One square to sideways or front corners
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    王(king): One square in any direction
                </h4>
            </div>

            <br/>
            <hr/>
            <br/>

            <h2>Additional Rules</h2>

            <h4>If the square your piece is landing on is one of your own piece, you cannot move to that square.</h4>
            <h4>If the square your piece is landing on is one of your opponent's piece, you may capture it. When a piece
                is captured, it becomes <strong>yours</strong> and stays in the pool. At any turn you may put a piece in
                the
                pool back onto the board instead of moving a piece.</h4>
            <h4>You have to make a move on each turn, either moving a piece or reviving a piece in the pool. You cannot
                skip. If you have no good moves, you are in a zugzwang position, but you have to admit and make a best
                move.</h4>
            <h4>If both players made no capture in the last 20 moves, the game is a draw.</h4>

            <br/>

            <h2>Using the website</h2>

            <h4>There are five panels on this website: board, pool, status, control, and rules.</h4>
            <h4>In the control panel, you can start a game, choose opponent, and change piece types. If you are not
                comfortable with the Chinese symbols, you can change it to international chess-like pieces.</h4>
            <h4>Have fun!</h4>
